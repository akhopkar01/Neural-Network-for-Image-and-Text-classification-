# Neural-Network-for-Image-and-Text-classification-
Part of CMSC498L coursework. In this porject, we implement binary classification of Images and Movie Reviews by implementing standard strategies of Neural Network. The project contains the python notebook, which will give an in depth walkthrough through the steps adopted to train the model. \\

***************************************************
The repo contains : \\
* src/ - This folder contains the two python notebook files :
1. nn_scratch.ipynb : Walkthrough for designing and implementing a neural network from scratch
2. NNtorch.ipynb : Walkthrough for implementing PyTorch

* Dataset/ - Contains the dataset to be loaded in the code files. Make sure that the notebook and the dataset files are in the same directory (preferrably, /home/user/../ ) and ensure that the dataset files are properly loaded in the code files
