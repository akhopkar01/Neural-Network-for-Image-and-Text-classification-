# Neural-Network-for-Image-and-Text-classification-
Part of CMSC498L coursework. In this porject, we implement binary classification of Images and Movie Reviews by implementing standard strategies of Neural Network. SGD can be seen implemented. The project contains the python notebook, which will give an in depth walkthrough through the steps adopted to train the model.
